We greatly appreciate community contributions to |project|. If you're thinking of adding new features, fixing bugs, or making any changes, this guide is designed to get you started and ensure the consistency and quality of the codebase.


Code Style and Guidelines
--------------------------

1. **Code Formatting**: We follow PEP 8, the style guide for Python code. We recommend using tools like `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ to check your code for PEP 8 compliance.

2. **Docstrings**: All functions, classes, and methods should have numpydoc-compliant docstrings. This ensures that our documentation remains consistent and readable. See the `numpydoc guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_ for reference.

3. **Testing**: Write tests for any new features or bug fixes. Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.


Feedback and Review
-------------------

Once you've submitted your pull request:

1. **Maintainer Review**: One of the maintainers will review your pull request. They may provide feedback or request changes. This is a collaborative process and an opportunity to ensure the quality and consistency of the codebase.

2. **Continuous Integration**: Ensure that your pull request passes all CI checks and tests.

3. **Merging**: Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the main branch.

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Your time and effort help improve |project| for everyone.
