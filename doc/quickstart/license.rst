PREAMBLE
--------

EMBL is an intergovernmental institution under public international law having legal personality, and being granted a variety of privileges and immunities for itself and its staff necessary for the fulfilment of its objectives and for the exercise of its functions, including as established by the “Agreement establishing the European Molecular Biology Laboratory” concluded at Geneva on May 10, 1973, registered with UN-Treaty Series Volume 954, Nr. I-13668.

EMBL has developed pyTME (Python Template Matching Engine), („Licensed Software“), a software library that generalizes template matching tasks with specialized tooling for cryo-electron microscopy data. The RECIPIENT intends to use the Licensed Software for research purposes only. For this purpose, the Parties agree on the following License Terms.

1.2.  Any installation or configuration or training and further support are not part of these License Terms. The RECIPIENT can contact  `valentin.maurer@embl-hamburg.de <mailto:valentin.maurer@embl-hamburg.de>`_ for help with the installation of the Licensed Software.

2. Rights of Use
----------------

2.1.  As of the Effective Date as defined in section 5 EMBL grants to RECIPIENT a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use the Licensed Software for non-commercial research purposes. For the purposes of these License Terms commercial means any use that directly or indirectly serves the purpose of generating revenues of any kind, irrespective of any intention to make a profit (“Commercial Use”) and including the purpose of performing research projects contracted by third parties against any kind of compensation (“Contract Research”). In particular service projects and collaborative research with for-profit organizations are always considered Contract Research.

2.2.  Commercial use of the Licensed Software, or derivative works based thereon, REQUIRES A COMMERCIAL LICENSE.  Should RECIPIENT wish to make commercial use of the Licensed Software, RECIPIENT will contact EMBLEM (`Info@embl-em.de <mailto:Info@embl-em.de>`_) to negotiate an appropriate license for such use.

2.3.  The user agrees that any reports or published results obtained with the Licensed Software will acknowledge its use by the citation of the publication associated with the Licensed Software.

2.6.  RECIPIENT agrees to reproduce the copyright notice and other proprietary markings on any derivative work and to include in the documentation of such work the citation of the publication associated with the Licensed Software.

2.7.  RECIPIENT who contributes their code to become an internal portion of the Licensed Software agrees that such code may be distributed by EMBL under the terms of this Software License Agreement and may, at EMBL’s sole discretion, be used or incorporated to make the basic operating framework of the Licensed Software a more stable, flexible, and/or useful product.

2.8.  RECIPIENT is not entitled to:

2.8.1.  use the Licensed Software for any Commercial Use including any Contract Research,

2.8.2.  sell, rent or lend the Licensed Software to others,
